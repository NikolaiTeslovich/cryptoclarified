### Information we collect and what we use it for

We run [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) on CryptoClarified. The following information is collected:

- __Date__. We gather the date when users access CryptoClarified to see how many people view our site. We do not gather at what hour or minute our content was accessed, solely the day. For example: _April 20, 2021_
- __Device type__. We use this to understand what devices people use when visiting this website. This is derived from window.innerWidth. The actual width of the browser in pixels is discarded. For example: _Desktop_.
- __Page URL__. We track the page URL of each page view on this website. We use this to understand which pages have been viewed and how many times a particular page has been viewed. For example: _https://cryptoclarified.netlify.app/_.
- __Search Query__. We use the search query to understand what our users are googling to get a sense for what pages are frequently viewed. For example: _bitcoin in simple terms_.
- __Visitor Country__. We look up the visitorâ€™s country using the IP address. We do not track anything more granular than the country of origin and the IP address of the visitor is discarded. We never store IP addresses in our database or logs. For example: _France_.
