## Preface

NVIDIA drivers on Linux are rather finicky and do not like being overclocked without a monitor connected to them, so I had to trick them using a combination of **lightdm** and some other commands.

After countless hours, probably even days of banging my head against the monitor in despair to have my rigs work headlessly, and be **actually be overclockable**, I wanted to find a way that was simple, yet have the code and process be open-source. In contrast to operating systems like HiveOS, or NHOS, using *MinerWrangler* in conjunction with Ubuntu Server, you can actually understand each step of the process and have full control over your rigs as providers of the blockchain.
