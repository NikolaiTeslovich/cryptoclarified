## Preface

I started cryptocurrency mining back in August 2017 on a GTX 1080â€”still a very good card todayâ€”in my gaming PC with NiceHash. That was when Bitcoin was worth about $4k. At the time, I was just a freshman in high school looking to make a quick buck, essentially money for free with my parents paying for the electricityâ€”it was afterall heating the basement. I was only slightly interested in cryptocurrencies, occasionally looking at the prices on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) during the otherwise boring English classâ€”except for when we watched Romeo and Juliet 1968, which if you've ever seen it, you would understandâ€”and re-partitioning my, at the time, Coinbase portfolio into a bit of ETH and LINK.

I kept on mining until the great bull and crash of 2017-2018. I clearly remember everybody in my family telling me to sell, sell, sell, while I still could. I probably would have, however I didn't have a way to withdraw those funds to a bank accountâ€”as I don't have one. Although some might look at this as a negative, it was a massive positive for me and taught me a lesson in patience. Compared to the prices at the time of writing this, $50k BTC and $2k ETH, I'm glad I held on and am still HODLing.

The only thing that I do regret, is stopping mining. I don't exactly remember why I stopped, probably because I lost interest due to the crash. However, I was still HODLing.

Fast forward to the Winter of 2019-2020, right before the Coronavirus pandemic took the world by a surprise. I decided to give crypto another chance after reading [The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)â€”a phenomenal read by the way. I went back to my old trusted method of NiceHash and Coinbase for a couple of weeks until I decided that I was sick of Windows 10. I was sick of stupid updates, the goddamn pop-up notifications that would cause me to crash my plane in WarThunder, and just the general clunky user interface. Plus, I was slowly moving away from computer gaming as my interest of RC flight took over. Linux, specifically Ubuntu, here I come!

Eventually, after countless hours, probably countless dozens of hours, I was mining ETH with PhoenixMiner this time, to [Exodus wallet](https://www.exodus.com/)â€”a wallet that I still use to this day. Fortunately, I heard of the OhGodAnETHlargementPill, which when administered to my GTX 1080 yielded me 35, maybe even 36 Mh/s.
